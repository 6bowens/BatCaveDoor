# BatCaveDoor
This is a Particle Electron sketch that I use to trigger my garage door opener when my motorcycle drives near my home. A predefined GPS location was compared (using haversine formula) to a wired GPS device, and when driven within a configurable radius, it triggers a button on the garage door opener. The code also includes some driving statistics sent to the Particle Cloud Console.
